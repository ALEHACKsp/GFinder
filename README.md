# GFinder
Dll console application that prints out the gname, gobject, and gworld address based on the patterns you input in the dllmain. I mainly use this to get the Gstuff address so I can check them in Reclass.
Note this is was something quick I made for me, just posting it for anyone else who needed a bit of help :P
